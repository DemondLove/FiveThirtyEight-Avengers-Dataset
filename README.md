GitHub Repository for DSC 510 - Bellevue University

The code and reports in this repo is for the Bellevue University DSC 510 course.

There are 3 data files, 3 processing files with 4 utility films, and 4 testing files also.

To exectute the source code, you will need to navigate to the msds510/src folder.

Here you will find 3 files:

* make_report.py, which is used to generate a Markdown formatted report of the top ten Avengers by the number of their appearances.

* process_csv.py, which is used to open avengers.csv, from FiveThirtyEight GitHub: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/avengers, already decoded from ISO-8859-1 to UTF-8.
Then export it with proper heading formatting and data cleaning.

* run_test.py, which is used to perform unit testing on both the make_report.py and process_csv.py modules.
